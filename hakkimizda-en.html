      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p>
        The "My Dream for 2030" project was created to enable children with special needs to freely express their dreams and visions about the world and the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is based on the principles of quality education, equality, and social inclusion in line with the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project was prepared by students from the Special Education Department of Düzce University Faculty of Education.
